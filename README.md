# Apps
## WebStorm
### Imports
- Importing {Box} from "ink" even though in 13948138413 files I import it from @mantine-ui/core
- Not suggesting auto-imports for components like <Text/>

# Libraries/Tools
## Prisma
- After running a db:migrate
  - I have to restart the dev server and studio
  - I have to go to the generated types so my editor (WebStorm) can pick up the type changes
